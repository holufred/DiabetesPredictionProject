Diabetes is a growing concern worldwide, with over 400 million people affected globally. The disease is associated with numerous complications, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage. As such, early detection and prevention is crucial. Since the dataset for this project has a label which is categorical, the task required a supervised classification algorithm, and the following models were implemented: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 
The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was used for this diabetes prediction project. The methodology was modified to the following 4 stages for the project.
1.	Data Understanding
2.	Data Preparation
3.	Modeling
4.	Evaluation
